##Basic 1

####Capitalizing Nouns

In German, all nouns are capitalized. For example: `my name` is `mein Name`, `the apple` is `der Apfel`.

####Three Grammatical Genders, Three Types of Nouns

Nouns in German are either feminine, masculine or neuter. For example: `Frau` (woman) is feminine, `Mann` (man) is masculine, and `Kind` (child) is neuter. The grammatical gender man not match the biological gender. Example: `Mädchen` (girl) is a neuter noun.

Generally speaking, the definite article `die` (the) and the indefinite article `eine` (a/an) are used for feminine nouns, `der` and `ein` for masculine nouns, and `das` and `ein` for neuter nouns. Example:

> **die Frau** **der Mann** and **das Kind**

However, this changes depending on something called the **case of the noun**.

####Umlauts

Umlauts are the two dots above some vowels in German words, such as in `Mädchen` Literally, **Umlaut** means **around the sound**, because its function is to _change how the vowel sounds_.

An umlaut can sometimes indicate the plural of a word. Example: the plural of `Mutter` (mother) is `Mütter`.

####Verb Conjugation

To conjugate a regular verb in the present tense, identify the **invariant stem** of the verb and add the ending corresponding to any of the grammatical persons:

|English Person|Ending|German Example|
|:-------------|:-----|:-------------|
| I | -e | ich spiel**e** |
| You (singular) | -st | du spiel**st** |
| He/She/It | -t | er/sie/es spiel**t** |
| We | -en | wir spiel**en** |
| You (plural) | -t | ihr spiel**t** |
| You (formal) | -en | Sie spiel**en** |
| They | -en | sie spiel**en** |

##Basic 2

####German cases

In English, the words `he` and `I` can be used as subjects (the ones doing the action in a sentence), and they change to `him` and `me` when they are objects (the ones the action is applied to). Example:

  > _He likes me_ and _I like him_

This is the notion of a **grammatical case**: the same word changes its form depending on its relationship to the verb. In English, _only pronouns_ have cases, but in German _most words other than verbs_ have cases: nouns, pronouns, determiners, adjectives, etc

Most words change are very predictably so only a small set of rules to memorize. First, let's consider the two simplest cases: **nominative** and **accusative**.

**The subject of a sentence** (the one doing the action) is in the _nominative case_. So when we say:

  > Die Frau spielt (The woman plays)

`Frau` is in the nominative.

_The accusative object_ is the **thing or person** that is **directly receiving the action**. Example:

  > Der Lehrer sieht den Ball (the teacher sees the ball)

`Lehrer` is the nominative object and `Ball` is the accusative object.

The articles for accusative objects are not the same as the articles for nominative objects:

|Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural|
|:---|:--------|:-------|:-----|:-----|
|Nominative|der|die|das|die|
|Accusative|den|die|das|die|

|Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|
|:---|:--------|:-------|:-----|
|Nominative|ein|eine|ein|
|Accusative|einen|eine|ein|

The fact that most words in German are affected by the case explain why the sentence order is more flexible than in English. For example:

  > Das Mädchen hat den Apfel (The girl has the apple)

vs

  > Den Apfel hat das Mädchen

In both cases, `den Apfel` is the accusative object, and `das Mädchen` is the nominative object.

####Conjungation of the Verb _sein_

The verb `sein` (to be) is irregular, and its conjugations simply need to be memorized:

|German|English|
|:-----|:------|
|Ich bin|I am|
|er/sie/es ist|He/she/it is|
|wir sind|we are|
|ihr seid|you(plural) are|
|sie sind|They are|
|Sie sind|you(formal) are|

####Contractions

When a preposition and a definite article are combined or contracted in German, a new word is formed. For instance: `in dem` (in the) becomes `im` like in:

  > Der Mann ist im Restaurant

Note that the best translation of a contraction **includes the definite article "the"**.

Common contractions:

|Original|Contraction|English|
|:-------|:----------|:------|
|an + dem|am|at the/on the|
|bei + dem|beim|by the/at the|
|zu + dem|zum|to the|
|zu + der|zur|to the|

##Common Phrases

####Simple German present tense

In English, the present tense can be simple or progressive (as in `I eat` or `I am eating`). Both forms translate to just one German present tense form, because there is **no continuous tense in standard German**. So, `she learns` and `she is learning` are both `sie lernt`.

####Wie GEHT'S?

There are many ways to ask someone how he or she is doing. For example: `How are you?`, `How do you do?` and `How is it going?`. In German, the common phrase or idiom uses the verb **gehen** (go):

  > Wie geht es dir? (How are you?)

####WILLKOMMEN CAN BE A FALSE FRIEND

In German, `WILLKOMMEN` mens welcome as in `Welcome to our home`, but it does not mean welcome as in `Thank you - You'er welcome`. The German for the latter case is `Gern geschehen` or `Keine Ursache`.
