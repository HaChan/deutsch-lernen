##Basic 1

####Capitalizing Nouns

In German, all nouns are capitalized. For example: `my name` is `mein Name`, `the apple` is `der Apfel`.

####Three Grammatical Genders, Three Types of Nouns

Nouns in German are either feminine, masculine or neuter. For example: `Frau` (woman) is feminine, `Mann` (man) is masculine, and `Kind` (child) is neuter. The grammatical gender man not match the biological gender. Example: `Mädchen` (girl) is a neuter noun.

Generally speaking, the definite article `die` (the) and the indefinite article `eine` (a/an) are used for feminine nouns, `der` and `ein` for masculine nouns, and `das` and `ein` for neuter nouns. Example:

> **die Frau** **der Mann** and **das Kind**

However, this changes depending on something called the **case of the noun**.

####Umlauts

Umlauts are the two dots above some vowels in German words, such as in `Mädchen` Literally, **Umlaut** means **around the sound**, because its function is to _change how the vowel sounds_.

An umlaut can sometimes indicate the plural of a word. Example: the plural of `Mutter` (mother) is `Mütter`.

####Verb Conjugation

To conjugate a regular verb in the present tense, identify the **invariant stem** of the verb and add the ending corresponding to any of the grammatical persons:

|English Person|Ending|German Example|
|:-------------|:-----|:-------------|
| I | -e | ich spiel**e** |
| You (singular) | -st | du spiel**st** |
| He/She/It | -t | er/sie/es spiel**t** |
| We | -en | wir spiel**en** |
| You (plural) | -t | ihr spiel**t** |
| You (formal) | -en | Sie spiel**en** |
| They | -en | sie spiel**en** |

##Basic 2

####German cases

In English, the words `he` and `I` can be used as subjects (the ones doing the action in a sentence), and they change to `him` and `me` when they are objects (the ones the action is applied to). Example:

  > _He likes me_ and _I like him_

This is the notion of a **grammatical case**: the same word changes its form depending on its relationship to the verb. In English, _only pronouns_ have cases, but in German _most words other than verbs_ have cases: nouns, pronouns, determiners, adjectives, etc

Most words change are very predictably so only a small set of rules to memorize. First, let's consider the two simplest cases: **nominative** and **accusative**.

**The subject of a sentence** (the one doing the action) is in the _nominative case_. So when we say:

  > Die Frau spielt (The woman plays)

`Frau` is in the nominative.

_The accusative object_ is the **thing or person** that is **directly receiving the action**. Example:

  > Der Lehrer sieht den Ball (the teacher sees the ball)

`Lehrer` is the nominative object and `Ball` is the accusative object.

The articles for accusative objects are not the same as the articles for nominative objects:

|Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural|
|:---|:--------|:-------|:-----|:-----|
|Nominative|der|die|das|die|
|Accusative|den|die|das|die|

|Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|
|:---|:--------|:-------|:-----|
|Nominative|ein|eine|ein|
|Accusative|einen|eine|ein|

The fact that most words in German are affected by the case explain why the sentence order is more flexible than in English. For example:

  > Das Mädchen hat den Apfel (The girl has the apple)

vs

  > Den Apfel hat das Mädchen

In both cases, `den Apfel` is the accusative object, and `das Mädchen` is the nominative object.

####Conjungation of the Verb _sein_

The verb `sein` (to be) is irregular, and its conjugations simply need to be memorized:

|German|English|
|:-----|:------|
|Ich bin|I am|
|er/sie/es ist|He/she/it is|
|wir sind|we are|
|ihr seid|you(plural) are|
|sie sind|They are|
|Sie sind|you(formal) are|

####Contractions

When a preposition and a definite article are combined or contracted in German, a new word is formed. For instance: `in dem` (in the) becomes `im` like in:

  > Der Mann ist im Restaurant

Note that the best translation of a contraction **includes the definite article "the"**.

Common contractions:

|Original|Contraction|English|
|:-------|:----------|:------|
|an + dem|am|at the/on the|
|bei + dem|beim|by the/at the|
|zu + dem|zum|to the|
|zu + der|zur|to the|

##Common Phrases

####Simple German present tense

In English, the present tense can be simple or progressive (as in `I eat` or `I am eating`). Both forms translate to just one German present tense form, because there is **no continuous tense in standard German**. So, `she learns` and `she is learning` are both `sie lernt`.

####Wie GEHT'S?

There are many ways to ask someone how he or she is doing. For example: `How are you?`, `How do you do?` and `How is it going?`. In German, the common phrase or idiom uses the verb **gehen** (go):

  > Wie geht es dir? (How are you?)

####WILLKOMMEN CAN BE A FALSE FRIEND

In German, `WILLKOMMEN` mens welcome as in `Welcome to our home`, but it does not mean welcome as in `Thank you - You'er welcome`. The German for the latter case is `Gern geschehen` or `Keine Ursache`.

##Food

####The German Preposition _am_

The German preposition `am` is the contraction of `an` (at/on) and `dem` (the).  For example:

  > Der Mann isst am (an + dem) Tisch (The man eats at the table)

Since `an` can translate to both _at_ and _on_, `am` can translate to both _at the_ and _on the_, depending on the context. Example:

  > an dem Tisch (at the table)

  context: spatial relationship between things

  > an dem Tag (on that day)

  context: temporal

####The verb _haben_ (to have)

In English, you can say "I'm having bread" when you really mean that you're eating or about to eat bread. **This does not work in German**. The verb `haben` **refer to possession only**. Hence, the sentence:

  > Ich habe Brot

only translates to _I have bread_, not _I'm having bread_. The same applies to drinks:

  > Ich habe Wasser

only translates to _I have water_ not _I'm having water_.

####_Mittagessen_ - lunch or dinner?

_Dinner_ is sometimes used synonymously with _lunch_, but here we are defining `Frühstück` as breakfast, `Mittagessen` as _lunch_, and _dinner / supper_ as _Abendessen / Abendbrot_.

####Compound words

A compound word is a word that **consists of two or more words**. These are **written as one word** (no spaces).

The **gender of a compound noun** is always **determined** by its **last element**. The **last element** is always the **most important one**. All the previous elements merely describe the last element.

  - **die** Auto**bahn** (das Auto + **die** Bahn)

  - **der** Oragen**saft** (die Orange + **der** Saft)

  - **das** Hunde**futter** (der Hund + **das** Futter)

Sometimes, there's a connecting sound (`Fugenlaut`) between two elements. Example:

  > die Orange + der Saft _becomes_ der Orange**n**saft

  > der Hund + das Futter _becomes_ das Hund**e**futter

  > die Liebe + das Lied _becomes_ das Liebe**s**lied

####Cute like sugar!

The word `süß` means _sweet_ when referring to **food**, and _cute_ when referring to **living beings**.

  - Der Zucker ist süß. (The sugar is sweet.)

  - Die Katze ist süß. (The cat is cute.)

##Plurals

####German Plurals - The Nominative Case.

In English, making plurals out of singular nouns is typically as straightforward as adding an `s` or an `es` at the end of the word. In German, the transformation is more complex, and also the articles for each gender change. The following five suggestions can help:

  1. `-e` ending: **most German one-syllable** nouns will need `-e` in their plural form. For example, in the nominative case, `das Brot` (the bread) becomes `die Brote`, and `das Spiel` (the game) becomes `die Spiele`.

  2. `-er` ending: **most masculine** or **neuter nouns** will need the `-er` ending, and there _may be_ umlaut changes. For example, in the nominative case `das Kind` (the child) becomes `die Kinder`, and `der Mann` (the man) becomes `die Männer`.

  3. `-n/-en` ending: **most feminine** nouns will take either `-n` or `-en` in all **four grammatical cases**, with **no umlaut changes**. For example, `die Frau` (the woman) becomes `die Frauen` and `die Kartoffel` becomes `die Kartoffeln`.

  4. `-s` ending: **most foreign-origin nouns** will take the `-s` ending for the plural, **usually** with **no umlaut changes**. For example: `der Chef` (the boss) becomes `die Chefs`.

  5. There is **no change** for **most neuter** or **masculine nouns** that _contain any of these in the singular_: `-chen`, `-lein`, `-el`, or `-er`. There **may be umlaut changes**. For example: `das Mädchen` (the girl) becomes `die Mädchen`, and `die Mutter` (the mother) becomes `die Mütter`.


####German Feminine Plurals - Nouns Ending in -in

Feminine nouns that end in `-in` will need `-nen` in the plural. For example, `die Köchin` (the female cook) becomes `die Köchinnen` in its plural form.


##Adjectives

####Predicate adjectives

_Predicate adjectives_, i.e adjectives that _don't precede a noun_, are **not inflected**:

  > Der Mann ist groß.

  > Die Männer sind groß.

  > Die Frau ist groß.

  > Die Frauen sind groß.

  > Das Haus ist groß.

  > Die Häuser sind groß.


The adjective remains in the base form, regardless of number and gender.

##Clothing

####Kleider - dresses or clothes?

`das Kleid` means _the dress_, and `die Kleider` means _the dresses_, but the plural `die Kleider` can also mean _clothes_ or _clothing_. In most cases, _clothing_ (or _clothes_) translates to `Kleidung` (usually _uncountable_, but It's important to be aware that `Kleider` can be used in that sense as well.

####Hose or Hosen?

Both `Hose` and `Hosen` translate to _pants_ (_trousers_ in British English), but they're **not interchangeable**. The singular `Hose` refers to **one pair of pants**, and the plural `Hosen` refers to **multiple pairs of pants**.

##Accusative Pronouns

####Personal Pronouns in the Accusative Case

Aside from the nominative case, most of the German pronouns are declined in each of the four cases. Like in English, when the subject becomes the object, the pronoun changes. For instance, `ich` changes to `mich` (accusative object) as in `Ich sehe mich` (I see me).

In the accusative case of the _third person pronouns_, **only the masculine gender shows the change**, thus neither the feminine "sie" nor the neuter "es" change. For example, "Er/Sie/Es mag ihn/sie/es" (He/She/It likes him/her/it).

|Nominative|Accusative|
|:---------|:---------|
|ich (I)|mich (me)|
|du (you)|dich (you)|
|er (he)|ihn (him)|
|sie (she)|sie (her)|
|es (it)|es (it)|
|wir (we)|uns (us)|
|ihr (you guys)|euch (you guys)|
|sie (they)|sie (them)|
|Sie (you)|Sie (you)|

####Demonstrative Pronouns in the Accusative Case

Similarly, **only the masculine gender** shows the change in the **demonstrative pronouns**: `der` (for "that one") changes to `den` but `die` and `das` (for "that one") remain the same.

The demonstrative pronouns in the accusative case are thus: `den` = that one (masculine), `die` = that one (feminine), `das` = that one (neuter), and for the plural, `die` = "these". Take this example: `Er isst den` is "He is eating that one (masculine);" `Er isst die` and `Er isst das` are both "He is eating that one", but for the other two genders.

##Conjunctions

A conjunction like `wenn` (when) or `jedoch` (however) connects two parts of a sentence together. In German, conjunctions do not change with the case (i.e the are not **declineable**).

_Subordinating conjunctions_ combine an **independent clause** with a **dependent clause**; the dependent clause cannot stand on its own and its word order will be different than if it did. For instance in:

    Er ist hungrig, weil er nichts aß` (he is hungry, because he ate nothing)

the clause starting with `weil` is the dependent clause, which would be ordered as `er aß nichts` if it stood by itself.

Coordinating conjunctions form a group of coordinators (`und` = and, `aber` = but), which combine two items of equal importance; here, each clause can **stand on its own** and the word order **does not change**.

Lastly, correlative conjunctions work in pairs to join sentence parts of equal importance. For instance: `entweder...oder` (either...or) can be used like this:

    Der Schuh ist entweder blau oder rot

##Questions

###Yes/No Questions

Questions can be asked by **switching the subject and verb**. Example:

> Du verstehst das. (You understand this)

Yes/No question form:

> Verstehst du das? (Do you understand this?)

These kinds of questions will generally just elicit yes/no answers.

###W questions

Six W-questions: `Wer` (_Who_), `Was` (_What_), `Wo` (_Where_), `Wann` (_When_), `Warum` (_Why_) and `Wie` (_How_); can be asked in German to elicit more than yes/no answers. Two of the six adverbs are declineable (i.e. change with the case), whereas four are not:

####Wer (Who)

`Wer` is **declineable** and needs to adjust to the four case. It depends on what the question is targeting.

  1. Ask for the **subject of a sentence** (i.e. the nominative object), `wer` remain as it is.

  > Wer sitzt da? (Who is sitting there?)

  2. Ask for the **direct (accusative) object** in a sentence, `wer` changes to `wen` (who/whom)

  > **wen** siehst du? (Whom do you see?); Ich sehe **den** Sohn.

  3. Ask for the **indirect object**, `wer` changes to `wem` (who/to whom) and **adjust to the dative case**.

  > **Wem** hast du den Apfel gegeben? (to whom did you give the apple?); **Dem Mann**

  The declined form of `wer` (`wem`) sounds like the definite article of all masculine and neuter nouns in the dative case (`dem Mann`).

  4. Asking about ownership (genitive case), changes `wer` to `wessen` (whose).

  > **Wessen** Schuhe sind das? (Whose shoes are these?); Das sind die Schuhe **des** Jungen. (These are the boy's shoes)

####Was (What)

`was` decline depending on the four cases:

  1. For **both nominative and accusative cases**, `was` remains the same. It's common to ask:

  > Wer oder was?

  to know more about the **nominative object** and don't know if it is a person (who) or a thing (what). And:

  > Wen oder was?

  is asked to know more about the **accusative object**.

  2. `Was` changes to `wessen` for question about the **genitive object** as:

  > Wessen ist sie schuldig? (What is she guilty of?)

  3. For the dative, `was` changes to a compound of `wo(r)` + preposition. For instance if the verb takes the German preposition `an` (on/about) as in:

  > an etwas denken

  then it should be asked like:

  > Woran denkt er? (what is he think about?)

  `hingehen` is a verb composed of `gehen` + `hin` (go + to) and the question should be:

  > Wohin geht sie? (to where is she going?)

####Wo (Where)

`Wo` is general question word for asking about locations. But when asking for **direction in which someone or something is moving**, `Wohin` is used instead. Example:

> Wo ist mein Schuh? (where is my shoe?)

> Wohin kommt dieser Wein? (Where does this wine go?)

`Wohin` is separable into `Wo` + `hin`. Example:

> Wo ist mein Schuh hin? (Where did my shoe go?)

####Wann (When)

`Wann` (when) **does not change depending on the case**. It _can be used with conjunctions_ such as `seit` (since) or `bis` (till):

> Seit wann haben Sie für Herrn Müller gearbeitet? (Since when have you been working for Mr. Müller?)

> Bis wann geht der Film? (Till when does the movie last?)

####Warum (Why)

`Warum` (why) is also **not declinable**. `Wieso` and `Weshalb` can be used instead of `Warum`.

> Warum ist das Auto so alt? (Why is that car so old?)

equal:

> Wieso ist das Auto so alt?

> Weshalb ist das Auto so alt?


##Dative Case

The **indirect object** in a sentence is called the **dative object**. The **indirect object** is the **receiver of the direct (accusative) object**. Example: `Frau` is the indirect (dative) object in:

> Das Mädchen gibt **einer Frau** _den Apfel_

The dative case is also used for certain **dative verbs** such as `danken` (to thank) and `antworten` (to answer), and with **dative prepositions** such as `von` (by/of) and `mit` (with). Example:

> Ich danke**dem Koch** (I thank the cook)

> Wir spielen mit **der Katze** (We play with the cat)

This case is known as the `Wem-Fall` (with whom-case), because to identify the word in the dative case, ask **"With/to whom ...?"** question.

Dative changes all articles for the words, the plural and pronouns. Example: `Frau` is a feminine noun but it will take masculine article to indicate the dative:

> Ich danke `der Frau` (I thank the woman)

|Case|Masculine|Feminine|Neuter|Plural|
|:---|:--------|:-------|:-----|:-----|
|Dative|dem|der|dem|den|
|Dative|einem|einer|einem||

Some masculine nouns add an `-en` or `-n` ending in the dative and in **all other cases besides the nominative**. For example in the dative, it is `dem Jungen` (the boy)

####German Plurals: The Dative Case

There are some exceptions when it comes to pluralizing nouns in the dative case:

  1. In dative case, the **one-syllable** plural noun always adds an `-en` ending (maybe umlaut changes). For "the hands" is `den Händen` and for `the dogs` it is `den Hunden`.

  2. For most masculine or neuter plural nouns, they will end in `-ern` in the dative case (maybe umlaut changes). Example: for "the books" it is `den Büchern`.

  > Der Junge lernt mit **den Büchern** (the boys learn with the books)

  3. Most neuter or masculine nouns ending in `-chen`, `-lein`, `-el` or `-er` end in `-n` in the dative case (maybe umlaut changes). Example: "the windows" it is `den Fernstern`, for "the mothers" it is `den Müttern`

  > Es funktioniert mit **den Fernstern** (it works with the windows)

  > Ich spreche mit **den Müttern**
