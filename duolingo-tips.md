##Basic 1

####Capitalizing Nouns

In German, all nouns are capitalized. For example: `my name` is `mein Name`, `the apple` is `der Apfel`.

####Three Grammatical Genders, Three Types of Nouns

Nouns in German are either feminine, masculine or neuter. For example: `Frau` (woman) is feminine, `Mann` (man) is masculine, and `Kind` (child) is neuter. The grammatical gender man not match the biological gender. Example: `Mädchen` (girl) is a neuter noun.

Generally speaking, the definite article `die` (the) and the indefinite article `eine` (a/an) are used for feminine nouns, `der` and `ein` for masculine nouns, and `das` and `ein` for neuter nouns. Example:

> **die Frau** **der Mann** and **das Kind**

However, this changes depending on something called the **case of the noun**.

####Umlauts

Umlauts are the two dots above some vowels in German words, such as in `Mädchen` Literally, **Umlaut** means **around the sound**, because its function is to _change how the vowel sounds_.

An umlaut can sometimes indicate the plural of a word. Example: the plural of `Mutter` (mother) is `Mütter`.

####Verb Conjugation

To conjugate a regular verb in the present tense, identify the **invariant stem** of the verb and add the ending corresponding to any of the grammatical persons:

|English Person|Ending|German Example|
|:-------------|:-----|:-------------|
| I | -e | ich spiel**e** |
| You (singular) | -st | du spiel**st** |
| He/She/It | -t | er/sie/es spiel**t** |
